# KeyStrokeLogger
This program is a key logger made for ethical reasons in use for penetration testing and grabbing keystrokes
It starts by grabing a exe at random from your %appdata% folder it then hijacks that file and adds it self to startup after the file full of all the logged text hits 100000 bytes
it clears the file right above that line of code you could possibly add something to send the file off to a server or something of that nature
